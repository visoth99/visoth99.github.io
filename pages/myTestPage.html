    &emsp;Midjourney AI is the web server that allows users to create a variety of unique images, beautiful images, or
    CGI (Computer Graphic Images). Those images are created by Artificial Intelligence that uses
    <strong>neural network algorithm</strong>. To create an images, users simply describe the worlds or phrase about
    the image they want, as well as some keywords such as Unreal Engine(Game development Software), aspect ratio,
    resolution, or width and height. And those describe words in this community called <strong>"Prompt"</strong>,
    but before putting this prompt users have to type <strong>"/image"</strong>. For example: /imagine the scenery of
    Cinderella death.<br>
